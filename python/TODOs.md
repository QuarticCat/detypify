# TODOs for python code

1. [x] Implement torch vision datasets and split, loading logic in `datasets.py`
2. [x] Split model details from `train.py` into `model.py`
3. [x] use torch lightning's LightningDataModule for better split
3. [ ] Add code to freeze decoder weights on initial rounds when fine-tuning
4. [ ] Change fine-tuning dataload logic to use pre-trained model's built-ins
